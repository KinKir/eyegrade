This release includes two main changes from the point of view
of the final user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved algorithms for the detection of manuscript digits and cell crosses,
based on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"&gt;support vector machines&lt;/a&gt;.
The system is much more precise now than in previous versions of Eyegrade.
This feature is based on the valuable contribution
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rarguelloF"&gt;Jorge Arqüello&lt;/a&gt;,
who developed its first version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution of binary packages built with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/"&gt;PyInstaller&lt;/a&gt;,
and a Windows installer built with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page"&gt;NSIS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation is much easier now than before.
Check the new
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/quick-start-guide.html"&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;
for instructions,
also accessible from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/documentation.html"&gt;documentation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(the accept button remains sometimes disabled

I've released Eyegrade 0.6.4 with a fix

This release includes just one main feature
that the users that don't build their exams with LaTeX
will find useful:
there is no need anymore to edit an exam configuration file
(the &lt;cite&gt;.eye&lt;/cite&gt; file)
manually.
Now you can choose,
when you create a new grading session,
to configure the session from a configuration file
or manually through the user interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Choosing how to configure the exam" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-1.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature has been developed
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jaraneda"&gt;Jonathan Araneda&lt;/a&gt;
from Chile.
In addition,
Roberto González set the requirements for this feature,
provided quite useful suggestions,
tested the new code
and sponsored Jonathan's work.
Thanks to both of them for their useful contribution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose the to configure the exam from a file,
all works like in the previous versions:
you just load the configuration file and proceed as always.
However,
if you choose to configure the exam manually,
you'll be able to enter the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of digits of the student id numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of choices per question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geometry of the answer tables
(how many tables and how many questions per table).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of models of the exam
(number of different exams you produced
by permuting the questions and their answers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key of the exam
(the correct choice for every question in every model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entering configuration parameters" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-2.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Editing the key of the exam" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-3.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dialogs are documented in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#manual-configuration-of-the-exam"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;.
In addition,
the configuration you entered can be exported
as a configuration file so that
you or your colleges can create new sessions with the same configuration
(see the &lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt; menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait,
what happened to the new OCR system
that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-06-include-part-1.html"&gt;I announced for the 0.6 release&lt;/a&gt;?
Unfortunately, I have to leave it for later.
Although it is ready,
it depends on some other changes regarding the installation procedure
that are not yet finished.
I prefer to keep them for the next release
in order to avoid delaying the session configuration feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-06-released.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bugfix release 0.5.1</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/bugfix-release-051.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've released Eyegrade 0.5.1.
This version does not include any new feature,
but addresses a bug
that caused an empty spurious exam
to be stores in the session database
through the &lt;em&gt;capture exam&lt;/em&gt; feature,
when used before the answer table of the current exam
were detected at least once.
Eyegrade would refuse to open this session anymore.
This release prevents the spurious exam to be stored in that case.
Additionally,
it allows Eyegrade to open the session
even when such an exam made its way into the session database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, you can update with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git pull&lt;/tt&gt;
if you installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/bugfix-release-051.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 22:51:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What will eyegrade 0.6 include? (part 1)</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-06-include-part-1.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though version 0.5 was released just a couple of weeks ago,
the next release, 0.6, is approaching.
As I did with the previous release,
I'll blog about the new features it will include
as they are more or less ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feature I'd like to talk about
is a new subsystem for recognizing handwritten digits,
which replaces the one that I wrote in the early days of Eyegrade.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rarguelloF"&gt;Rodrigo Argüello&lt;/a&gt;,
a former student of mine
at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uc3m.es/"&gt;Universidad Carlos III de Madrid&lt;/a&gt;,
volunteered to improve the previous system with a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;
based solution.
More specifically,
he used a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"&gt;support vector machine (SVM)&lt;/a&gt;.
The machine is trained by showing it lots of samples of each digit,
and telling it which digit each sample represents.
Once trained,
you can show an image of a digit to it,
and it will answer with the digit it considers
the best match for the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo tried with several strategies
before finally integrating one into Eyegrade.
Our first tests in real scenarios show that,
under conditions in which the former system failed
approximately once for every 6 student identifications,
the new system fails approximately once for every 20.
I believe it is a big step forward.
Many thanks to Rodrigo for his great contribution,
and to Roberto for sending us tons of samples
for training and testing the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the old digit recognition system
provides a second benefit:
the &lt;em&gt;tre&lt;/em&gt; library is no longer needed.
The fact that it wasn't a pure Python library,
and that it doesn't seem to be widely used from Python,
was a headache for deploying the Windows version,
and complicated the installation procedure in Linux a little bit.
If everything goes as planned,
you can expect a greatly simplified installation procedure,
especially for Windows users.
More on this topic on my next post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>new-features</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-06-include-part-1.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2015 20:42:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.5 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-05-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've finally released Eyegrade 0.5.
As I've advanced in the previous four posts,
its new features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stores exam captures and updates their miniatures immediately
when they are captured or you edit an answer or the student id
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've reworked the subsystem that manages the identity of the students.
Optionally, students may now have separate first and last name,
and there is a new dialog for entering new students
when they aren't in your student lists
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-2.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#student-list-files"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each question in a exam can have now a different weight in the final scores.
This way, you can assign a bigger weight to the most important questions
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-3.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#scores"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't want a question to contribute to the score of the exam,
now you can do it when creating the session.
For example, it is useful when you discover an error
in the statement of a question,
but it's too late for fixing it.
With this feature you can avoid grading that question
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-4.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#modifying-the-student-id"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program from versions in the series 0.2.x and later
by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#updating-eyegrade"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that Eyegrade 0.5 uses an updated session database schema.
Although Eyegrade 0.5 is able to work
with sessions created by the previous versions of Eyegrade,
those previous versions don't work
with sessions created by Eyegrade 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-05-released.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 18:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
